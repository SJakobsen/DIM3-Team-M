##Level 3 DIM Team Project

##Go!Fish

We are using the standard version of python described in the Tango With Django book. To run this project on your own machine, enter the go_fish_project directory and run the following commands:

python manage.py syncdb

(Create an admin account if you wish to use the administration page)

python populate_gofish.py

python manage.py runserver

Now, to view the project in your browser, simply navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/gofish/

Your admin account is not linked to a player, so be sure to register and then login in order to start playing as yourself. ALternatively, there are some fake user accounts that you can use instead. These are Adam, Mary, Jake, Penelope and Conrade. To login, their names are both the username and password (the first letter is a capital in both).  However, these accounts do not differ much apart from the money they have and the equipment they own.
